### Instructions 

- This problem involves a special 4-digit lock named "FeruLock." The lock displays a 4-digit value, and the goal is to find the minimum number of button presses needed to unlock the lock, given a specific set of buttons that can be pressed. Each button has a number associated with it, and pressing a button adds its value to the current displayed value, considering only the least significant 4 digits.

### Example Command

- None for now.
